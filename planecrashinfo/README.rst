Introduction
------------

This is an exploration of data found at http://planecrashinfo.com, a site that collects a lot of data about plane crashes back to ca. 1920. While it does a great job at collecting that data it presents only few plots trying to help with interpreting it. This notebook attempts to provide the means for easily accessing the data and exploring it using a more analytic/interactive/visual approach. To do so, standard tools from a Python-based data science stack are used, like Jupyter_, Pandas_, and Matplotlib_/Basemap_.

.. _Jupyter: http://jupyter.org
.. _Pandas: http://pandas.pydata.org
.. _Matplotlib: http://www.matplotlib.org
.. _Basemap: http://matplotlib.org/basemap/

**N.B.** This is work in progressâ€¦ If you have any suggestion, please feel free to raise an issue or provide a pull request.


Installation
------------

Using Python 3 is recommended, because this is the future! And Conda ist the recommended packaging system, since Pip cannot install Basemap. To install all dependencies, just run the following in your root environment::

  conda install basemap
  conda install pandas
  conda install jupyter
  pip install geopy

or set-up a new environment like this (should take < 30 secs)::

  conda create -n planes basemap pandas jupyter
  source activate planes
  pip install geopy
  ...
  # this is to remove the environment again:
  source deactivate
  conda env remove -n planes


Preparation
-----------

For the notebook to execute correctly it needs two data files, both included in this repo, ``data.csv`` and ``geolocs.json``. These can also be created by running the following commands, respectively::

  python build_database.py
  python build_geolocations.py

This might take quite a while, ca. 1-2 hours, and create a few additional CSV files, which are not needed for the notebook, but can be nice to play with.


Exploration
-----------

To get started exploring the data, just run the Jupyter notebook as follows::

  jupyter-notebook planecrashinfo.ipynb
